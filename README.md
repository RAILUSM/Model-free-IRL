# Model-free Maximum-Likelihood IRL
Model-free Inverse Reinforcement Learning Code

The project's main function is in <tt>src/DriverClass.java</tt>. Currently set to run Q-Averaging on Grid World with no-noise trajectories. Change the algorithm (to Q-SoftMax) or the domain in <tt>src/DriverClass.java</tt>. The trajectory data used to generate the results in the paper below are in the data folder.
